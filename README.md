# learning-sass

  * Introduction au Sass
  * Reproduction d'une animation

# Technique
  * Sass 
  * Animation css


# Ready, Steady, Go (with Sass compiler)!
 * Create the repository: learning-sass
 * Create a basic html file : index.html, just so we have something to play with.
 * Create a folder and call it assets : it will contain all static files necessary for the visual look of the interface you are going to create. Images, css, javascript, fonts ...
 * This "assets" folder structure has become a form of convention among frontend developers. Of course, it's up to you to get away from it, if you like reinventing the wheel.
 * Create a style.scss file and configure your sass application to generate the style.css file each time the "source" file (style.scss) is modified.
 * Make sure that your html file contains a <link rel="stylesheet" ... > refering to your.css file (and not to the.scss file).
